### Technical details on the relationship between word meanings, parts of speech, and definitions

- A **word** that is found in the English dictionary may have one or
more **meaning**s
  - each **meaning** can have one or more **parts of speech**. 
  - each combination of **meaning** and **part of speech** will have one or more 
  **definitions**. 

- Example: the word *bark* has 4 meanings. Take the first meaning:
a dog's bark. This meaning has 2 parts of speech (*noun* and *verb*). 
The noun has 1 definition `the sharp explosive cry of a dog, fox, or seal`.  
The verb has 2 definitions `(of a dog, fox, or seal) give a bark` and 
`utter (a command or question) abruptly or aggressively`. So we have a total
of 3 definitions just for the first of four meanings of 'bark' (and more for
the second, third, and fourth). 

- If a word cannot be found in the English dictionary a 0-row data.frame will be
rturned, and message to that effect printed to the console (e.g. 
`define("sdlkfjsldkjf")`).

### More examples

"hello"

```{r}

define("hello")

```


"bark" 

```{r}

define("bark")

```


"set" (..is said to have more meanings than any other English word!)

```{r}

define("set")

```


"lead" is an example of a [heteronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_(linguistics))
(a word that has a different pronunciation and 
meaning from another word but the same spelling)


```{r}

define("lead") %>% 
  group_by(meaning_number) %>% 
  slice(1)

```

Visit the audio links for the first and second definitions of "lead":

2. https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/20200429/lead--_gb_2.mp3



### Advanced usage


Iterate over many words


```{r}

words <- c("hello", "bark", "set", "lead")

map_df(words, ~ define(.x))

```
