### On the relationship between word meanings, parts of speech, and definitions

- A **word** that is found in the English dictionary may have one or
more meanings
  - each meaning can have one or more **parts of speech**. 
  - each combination of meaning and part of speech will have one or more 
  definitions. 

For example, the word *bark* has 4 meanings. Let's take the firs meaning:
a dog's bark. This meaning has 2 parts of speech (*noun* and *verb*). 
The noun has 1 definition `the sharp explosive cry of a dog, fox, or seal`.  
The verb has 2 definitions `(of a dog, fox, or seal) give a bark` and 
`utter (a command or question) abruptly or aggressively`. So we have a total
of 3 definitions just for the first of four meanings of 'bark' (and more for
the second, third, and fourth). Language is complicated :) 

- If a word cannot be found in the English dictionary a 0-row data.frame will be
rturned, and message to that effect printed to the console (e.g. 
`define("sdlkfjsldkjf")`).
